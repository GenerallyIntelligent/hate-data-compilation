ABOUT: Contains Twitter Tweet IDs for tweets which are considered to contain harassment or bullying. Seperated into a general dataset pulled from Twitter as a whole, and a dataset of Tweets related to schools.
METHOD: Twitter messages (Tweets) were collected from the public stream between 2012-10-20 and 2012-12-30. The labeling was done by three annotators and a label was chosen by a consensus of two. Data was collected in chronological order until "a substantial amound of Online Harassment messages was found." Excluded from the dataset were:
- Non-English
- spam
- empty
- Re-Tweets (To avoid duplication of message content)
The school dataset was collected by the same method, except only Tweets containing the words "school", "class", "college" and "campus" were considered.
